Notes on phase IV:

- the light direction is assumed to be the direction towards the light.
- For lighting to work properly when scales are applied to models, the following code should be added to the initialization:

	glEnable(GL_RESCALE_NORMAL);
	
	Activating this feature will result in normalized normals after applying the geometric transformations, and before applying lighting. This is relevant when using scales-
	
- To allow for ambient colors to be reproduced without having to activate the ambient component for all lights, the following code should be added to the initialization:

	float amb[4] = { 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f };
	glLightModelfv(GL_LIGHT_MODEL_AMBIENT, amb);
	
- Regarding texture mapping as provided in the screen shots, groups may offer different mappings for the cone and box, in which case the group should build a project XML file to illustrate their mapping.
